									<h2>Overview</h2>
										<p> Heart disease is the leading cause of death in America, and racial inequities for patients with heart failure have been widely documented.
										Recent studies, including one published by the American Heart Association (AHA) <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.119.006214"> here </a>, suggest that notable differences in care based on identified race in heart failure patients are likely driving
										these disparate outcomes. The <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/race-discrimination-and-cardiovascular-disease/2014-06"> AHA Journal of Ethics take on cardiology and discrimination</a> is a good jumping-off point
									 	for understanding how race informs care throughout the specialty. Here we hope to cover a few specific topics within the field in depth. </p>

							<h2> Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease </h2>

							<!-- Quotations -->
							<blockquote>“Two 48-year-old men, Jake and Earl, walk into a physician's office. They both have a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, a high density lipoprotein level of 40 mg/dL, systolic blood pressure of 130 mm (despite anti-hypertension treatment), and no history of diabetes. Their physician applies the same primary prevention guidelines, and – despite their identical cardiac risk factors – recommends an aspirin and a statin for Earl, but not Jake. These patients might be surprised to find their discrepant treatment derives from the fact that Jake is white and Earl is African-American.” <br> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5558842/"> Paulus and Kent (2018) </a></blockquote>
							<blockquote>“The greatest discordance due to misestimation was noted among black adults, among whom 33% had 2013 equation risk estimates less than 70% or greater than 250% those of white adults with otherwise-identical risk factor values.” <br> Sanjay Basu, MD, PhD</blockquote>

								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<p>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States, responsible for over 200,000 preventable deaths due to heart disease and stroke. Much of the management and prevention of these conditions lies in their correct, prompt diagnosis via calculation of risk. In an attempt to address this, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association released the Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults (Circulation. 2014;129:S1-45) in 2013 that markedly extended treatment recommendations for a greater pool of eligible patients. The associated ASCVD Risk Calculator now includes age, sex, race (white, African American, or other), blood pressure, cholesterol, history of diabetes mellitus, smoking history, and current treatment (anti-hypertensive, statin, and/or aspirin). By entering associated values, an individual can obtain their estimated 10-year risk for developing ASCVD. As a result, a much greater number of Americans qualified for and received treatment to lower such a risk. </p>
										<p>Despite the greater overall number of patients treated with an anti-hypertensive, statin, or aspirin as a result of the updated guidelines, extensive disparities exist across particular populations. Compared with whites, those who are Black and Hispanic were less likely to be prescribed a statin. Further, females with ASCVD were less likely to be prescribed a statin than males. These studies indicate that minority demographic groups are not being treated to the same degree as majority groups across the U.S. As such, it is on physicians to analyze, brainstorm, and address why this is the case and what we can do to change it. Some current calls to action within our medical community are cited here. </p>

							<!-- Quotations -->
							<blockquote>"The problem with BiDil is not only that it biologizes race but also that it distorts public understanding of health disparities." <br> <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.W5.455">Sankar & Khan (2005)</a></blockquote>
							<blockquote>"In the case of BiDil, no genetic markers were used to obtain a population sample in the clinical trial. Second, there are no racial genes, no clear genomic divide between any of society's socially constructed racial categories, and no stable cluster of medically relevant genes that is necessarily linked with ancestry or skin colour." <br> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60052-X/fulltext#:~:text=The%20US%20Food%20and%20Drug,multiracial%20population%20with%20heart%20disease">Krimsky (2012)</a></blockquote>
							<blockquote>"BiDil’s success, however, is one not of personalized medicine but of exploiting race to gain commercial and regulatory advantage in the pharmaceutical marketplace." <br> <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.W5.455">Sankar & Khan (2005)</a></blockquote>
							<div class="row">
								<!-- Description -->
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<p>In 2005, BiDil, a combination pill of two standard therapies utilized in heart failure (hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate), became the first drug to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a specific racial group. The original clinical clinical trials for this drug in the 1980s were not centered around racial groups. However, when the FDA denied its use due to insufficient statistical power for the drug’s efficacy, a second pharmaceutical company, NitroMed, re-examined the clinical trial data solely along racial lines and several researchers (9 out of the 11 authors) with direct financial ties to NitroMed conducted an additional clinical trial of Black self-identifying participants in order to gain FDA approval. The research that led to the FDA approval of BiDil has become a well known case of poorly designed, race-based research with numerous methodological limitations and confounding factors - such as the use of self identified race, no unifying genetic markers of the study population, no comparison group - that make it more of a race marketing campaign than a study that promoted the wellbeing of marginalized patient populations. </p>

									<h2>About</h2>

									<p> Our goal is to help organize and distill the ever-growing body of work on racism in medicine. We hope this project will be a resource to those advocating for antiracism in healthcare - from patients and providers to students, administrators, and policy makers who are pushing for change.</p>
									<p> If you have feedback or want to contribute content, please reach out! This is a work in progress. We’re always looking for new resources, perspectives, and thoughts on what makes people listen.</p>
