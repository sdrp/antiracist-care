								<!-- Description -->
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, articles are regularly published that build on racist frameworks or actively promote the codification of genetic differences between races. We are taught that peer-reviewed literature is the gold standard of science, which can sometimes predispose us to trust the conclusions put forth in peer-reviewed articles, even when the conclusions are based on faulty scientific principles and practices. Here are some questions you can ask to evaluate the legitimacy of articles that reference race.  </p>
									 <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In discussing the points here, we will use examples from a <a href= "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joim.13090">problematic article published by Gower and Fowler </a> in the Journal of Internal Medicine, and a <a href= "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joim.13153"> Letter to the Editor response by Tsai et al. </a> All cited worke can be found at the <a href= "#WORKS_CITED">bottom of the page.</a> </p>

							<p> Examine the paper’s definition of race or races. Are the definitions social in nature? Do the authors distinguish between race and ethnicity? Are they specific to one society or nation?

							<h2> 6) Do the authors reference racism or only race?  </h2>
							<p>   If there is a reference to race, but no reference to racism, the authors are not fully investigating the implications of their study categories. At times, race has its place as a marker in research when investigating where inequities lie; however, this should be done in the context of structural barriers to care, which often invokes a discussion of racism. Race is not a biomarker and varies tremendously between societies.  </p>

									<h2>About</h2>

									<p> Our goal is to help organize and distill the ever-growing body of work on racism in medicine. We hope this project will be a resource to those advocating for antiracism in healthcare - from patients and providers to students, administrators, and policy makers who are pushing for change.</p>
									<p> If you have feedback or want to contribute content, please reach out! This is a work in progress. We’re always looking for new resources, perspectives, and thoughts on what makes people listen.</p>
