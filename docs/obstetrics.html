										<h3>Topic & Clinical Relevance</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), a blood loss after birth of >1000mL, is a leading cause of death bothworldwide and in the U.S. The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony, in which the uterinemuscles do not contract adequately after birth, which leads to a lack of compression of the blood vessels, resulting in significant bleeding (Oyelese & Ananth, 2020; Bateman et al., 2010). </li>
											<li>Racial and ethnic disparities persist in atonic PPH and severe atonic PPH despite adjustment for
											numerous potential explanatory variables. Literature demonstrates that Hispanic and Asian/Pacific
											Islander birthing people have higher rates of PPH. While Black/African American birthing people
											have a similar or even slightly lower rate of PPH overall in these studies, they experience a higher rate
											of severe PPH that result in blood transfusions and hysterectomy as a measure to stop the bleeding
											(Bryant et al., 2012; Gyamfi-Bannerman et al., 2018; Wetta et al., 2013). </li>
											<li>Identifying risk factors for severe PPH in advance and being prepared for and ready to treat heavy
											bleeding are key interventions to reducing morbidity and mortality due to PPH. Widely used models
											to identify those at high risk such as the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC)
											OB Hemorrhage Toolkit V3.0 Errata 7.18.22 | California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative have
											historically used Asian race and Hispanic ethnicity, but not Black race, as independent risk factors for
											PPH. Many hospitals may still be using these older tools, which lead to differential risk stratification
											and care based on race (Lagrew et al., 2022).</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Historical Roots</h3>

										<ul>
											<li>Black, Indigenous, and other birthing people of color experience high rates of maternal morbidity
											and mortality (Artiga, 2020). This phenomenon has often been misattributed to genetics and culture.
											Multiple organizations are working toward eliminating these disparities and inequities by centering
											those most impacted, including Every Mother Counts and National Birth Equity Collaborative. </li>
											<li>Race and ethnic categories are not discrete biological groups. The U.S. Office of Management and
											Budget, whose definition is used on the U.S. Census, defines "Hispanic or Latino" as a person of
											Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin
											regardless of race (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). Hispanic ethnicity is thus a broad category that
											encompasses a wide range of ancestries and races. Additionally, Asian/Pacific Islander race includes
											individuals from countries and ancestral origins as different as India, the Philippines, Japan, and
											Cambodia (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). Racial and ethnic groupings are thus poor proximate
											indicators for genetic ancestry.</li>
										</ul>


										<h3>Frequent Misconceptions</h3>

										<ul>
										  <li><b><em>“Higher rates of PPH in Hispanic and Asian Pacific Islander birthing people, and higher rates of severe PPH in Black birthing
											people, represent race-based, biological differences in birthing risk”</b></em>
											<ul>
												<li>Review articles from electronic health record data describe higher rates of PPH in patients with
												Asian/Pacific Islander race and Hispanic ethnicity, and higher rates of severe PPH requiring
												transfusion and hysterectomy in non-Hispanic Black patients (Bryant et al., 2012; Gyamfi-Bannerman
												et al., 2018; Wetta et al., 2013). In the papers, authors explicitly state that the higher rates of PPH in
												Hispanic and Asian Pacific Islander patients may indicate a genetic or biological cause.</li>
												<li>Given that these articles were primarily retrospective chart reviews, it is unclear how racial and ethnic
												data points were collected and entered, rendering these categorical associations unreliable.</li>
												<li>Even if the racial and ethnic data points collected were an accurate approximation of an individual’s
												self-identified race and ethnicity, neither race nor ethnicity are an accurate predictor of genetic
												makeup (Cerdeña, 2022).</li>
											</ul>
											</li>

									<h3>How Adjustment Contributes to Health Inequity</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Using a PPH risk assessment tool that includes Asian race and Hispanic ethnicity as biological
										markers for PPH may lead to Asian and Hispanic patients having higher PPH risk scores and an
										increase in the rate of intervention, including blood draws, administration of additional medications,
										and reduced access to birthing options that are restricted to “low risk” birthing patients.</li>
										<li>Black patients experience severe PPH resulting in transfusion and hysterectomy at higher rates. If
										using a risk scoring system like the one above, clinicians may develop a false sense of security of
										lower risk of PPH, delayed diagnosis, and worse outcomes related to PPH.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
									<ul>
										<li> We should acknowledge that multiple studies have found increased frequency of significant maternal
										morbidities among specific racial and ethnic groups (Asian or Hispanic), including PPH, and we
										should use this increased rate to guide our caution in caring for patients from these backgrounds in
										order to not underdiagnose or undertreat them.</li>
										<li>We must also acknowledge that it is possible that Black patients are not actually experiencing a lower
										rate of PPH, but that they are receiving a delayed or under-diagnosis, such that once PPH is
										recognized, it is severe and more likely to require transfusions and dramatic measures to stop
										bleeding such as a hysterectomy.</li>
										<li> Race and ethnicity should not be used as a proxy for biological risk factors but as markers of
										increased risk of misdiagnosis and exposure to the effects of clinician bias.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Takeaway Points</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Racial and ethnic disparities exist for postpartum hemorrhage, with Hispanic and Asian Pacific
										Islander birthing people having higher overall rates of PPH, and non-Hispanic Black individuals
										having higher rates of severe PPH, but these inequities are not due to inherent biological or genetic
										differences.</li>
										<li>Clinicians should use utilize risk assessment tools using demonstrated biological, perinatal, and
										obstetric conditions that increase the risk of atonic PPH, such as the CMQCC updated hemorrhage
										toolkit (Lagrew, 2022) and take adequate measures (e.g., active management of the 3rd stage of labor,
										having uterotonics readily available) to reduce the incidence and consequences of PPH in all birthing
										people.</li>
